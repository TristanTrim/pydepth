Hullo hallo hello.

This is our (me and 'd.a's) attempt at a program to get depth information from photographs, and then convert them to 3d pointclouds/models.
It is written in python, and requires the following modules:

	numpy

	matplotlib

	scipy

	os

	argparse



right now the fuctionality is limited, but to run it, just type:

~]$ python path/to/main.py path/to/image.jpg



lucks!



the information here may not be compleat or accurate as I have not slept.
